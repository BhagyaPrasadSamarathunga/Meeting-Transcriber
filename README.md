## Project Overview

This project is a MVP builld to:

- Upload an audio file
- Transcribe speech to text
- Display the transcript
- Download transcript as a .txt file

The application is implemented using a full-stack Next.js architecture, where both frontend and backend logic live within the same project.

## Tech Stack

- Framework: Next.js (Full-stack React framework)
- AI Service: OpenAI Whisper API
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library

## Development setup

- ESLint
- Prettier
- Typescript for type safety

## Application Setup

- Create .env.local file
- Copy the content from .env.template
- Replace the open ai key with your key

```bash
npm install

npm run dev

```
- Open [http://localhost:3000]
  
## Running Tests

```bash
npm test

```


## Limitation

- **File Size Restriction:**
  
  The OpenAI Whisper API supports audio files up to 25 MB per request. Larger files must be split into smaller segments before transcription.
- **Language Support:**
  
  Language availability and transcription quality depend on the languages officially supported by the OpenAI Whisper API. Performance may vary for languages outside the documented supported   list.

## Further improvements

- Allow multiple file upload
- Allow user to edit the transcript and download
- Support translation
- Store transcripts in a database for allowing history view
- Show the upload progress
- Increase unit test and E2E testing coverages.
- Improve error handling.
- Performance enhance by split long recordings into smaller segments for faster transcription.
